          <h2>Best Money Making Apps For Putting Extra Change In Your Pocket</h2>

<p>You most likely have at least a dozen or so mobile apps on your phone that were free to download but ended up costing you money in order to use certain features.</p>

<p>While those apps will drain your bank account if you’re not careful, there are many others that actually help do the exact opposite.</p>

<p>The following is a list of apps that will leave you with more money than you started with before downloading them. While they probably won’t make you rich, every little bit counts! If you use them all together, they may help you out a little when the monthly bills roll in.</p>

<p>Whether earning cash back or gift cards through rebates and coupons, or making a little extra scratch through freelance work, these apps could earn you hundreds - possibly even thousands - of dollars over the course of a year.</p>

<h2>S’more</h2>

<p>When you download <a href="https://www.smoreapp.co">S’more</a>, you’ll actually have a reason to leave your phone in the other room once in a while.</p>

<p>S’more presents silent advertisements on your phone’s lock screen (when your device isn’t being used) in exchange for reward points. The points you accumulate can eventually be exchanged for gift cards to popular retailers and online stores. Whether you use these gift cards yourself or exchange them with others for cash is up to you.</p>

<p>S’more is the one app appearing on this list which requires you do absolutely nothing in order to start earning. In fact, the less you do, the better. As long as your phone is not in use and your lock screen is active, S’more will continue presenting ads, and you’ll continue earning points.</p>

<p>And don’t worry; you won’t need to keep your phone charging at all times after downloading the app. Although S’more will utilize your phone’s screen at all times, its creators have optimized the app so that it doesn’t drain your battery.</p>

<p>Due to Apple’s terms of service, S’more is currently only available for Android devices. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lab465.SmoreApp">You can download it here.</a></p>

<h2>Fiverr</h2>

<p>If you find yourself with a decent amount of spare time after you leave your day job and want to earn some extra cash, check out <a href="https://www.fiverr.com" rel="nofollow">Fiverr</a>.</p>

<p>Fiverr is a freelancer database that connects clients and specialists in a variety of fields, from journalism and advertising to graphic design and programming. There’s also an entire section dedicated to entertainers, as well.</p>

<p>The gigs you’ll find on Fiverr are usually short, less-involved projects that those with a specific talent should be able to finish within an hour at most. With hundreds of thousands of potential clients looking for specialists to complete individual tasks, you’ll always be able to find interesting work on Fiverr.</p>

<p>Fiverr is great for those getting started as freelancers. Though the gigs advertised are usually not very in-depth, completing them well could lead to higher-paying jobs with the same client in the future. It’s also a great way to build up a portfolio of published work, as well.</p>

<p>The only drawback is, by nature of the service, you’ll only earn $5 for each task you complete. It’s definitely a good place to start for high school or college students looking to get their foot in the door within an industry, but you probably won’t earn enough to make a living using Fiverr.</p>

<h2>Ibotta</h2>

<p>If you’ve recently looked at a receipt from a grocery store and wondered how you could have possibly spent so much, you definitely need to check out <a href="https://www.ibotta.com" rel="nofollow">Ibotta</a>.</p>

<p>Ibotta offers rebates on various grocery items when purchased from over 180 stores throughout the country. You simply take a picture of your receipt and upload it to the app, and your account will be credited accordingly. You’ll only receive rebates on items currently being featured on the app, but when it comes to saving at the grocery store, every little bit counts.</p>

<p>You’ll also be given bonuses if you link your Ibotta account with a specific store’s loyalty account, as well. In addition, you can also earn bonuses by joining “teams” and reaching certain monthly goals together.</p>

<p>Once you start earning, you can “cash out” through PayPal or Venmo, or you can purchase gift cards with your rebated cash if you choose to do so.</p>

<p>Depending on the purchases you make, you’re almost guaranteed to save hundreds over the course of an entire year. If you use Ibotta to its fullest capacity, you might even save thousands.</p>

<h2>Shopkick</h2>

<p>For those who genuinely love every aspect of shopping, there’s <a href="https://www.shopkick.com" rel="nofollow">Shopkick</a>.</p>

<p>Shopkick allows users to accumulate reward points throughout every step of the shopping process. To start, you earn points simply for going to a store and “checking in” in the first place. From there, you’ll earn points for scanning popular items - even if you don’t end up buying them. Of course, you’ll earn the most points for purchasing items and scanning the receipts - especially if you make these purchases with a credit card you’ve connected with your Shopkick account.</p>

<p>Shopkick works at a variety of retail stores, from JCPenney and Macy’s to Target and Best Buy. Depending on which stores you visit - as well as the amount you spend at each - you’ll earn a specific amount of points for each part of the process.</p>

<p>The only major drawback - which some might not see as a problem at all - is that, since you’ll need to check in to specific stores to earn reward points, Shopkick requires you to turn your location services on. It might not be that big of a deal to some, but to others the reward points might not be worth the invasion of privacy. Not to mention the fact that location services tend to drain your mobile device’s battery.</p>

<p>As with S’more, you’ll be able to redeem your collected reward points for gift cards rather than cold, hard cash. But, again, what you do with those gift cards is up to you. At the very least, you’ll end up saving money on stocking stuffers come the holiday season, right?</p>
